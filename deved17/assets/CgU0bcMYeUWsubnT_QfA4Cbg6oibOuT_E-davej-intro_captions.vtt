00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.160
Hi there. I'm David Juergens i'm with the office&nbsp;
of educational development here at osu chs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.000
today's session is on navigating those item&nbsp;
analysis reports we send you. When students have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
completed an exam we send you these nice reports&nbsp;
with a lot of numbers on them, but what does all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.960
of that mean? So to help us discern some of this&nbsp;
information today are my colleagues from OED,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.960
Vladimir Merisca and Brea Moore. So we have a lot&nbsp;
to cover. Start with our learning objectives here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.800
so students have taken an exam we present you&nbsp;
with the item analysis report so the first step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.200
is to recognize the item analysis statistics and&nbsp;
then secondly, we'll go into understanding how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.000
to analyze the exam metrics and there's a lot of&nbsp;
statistical information in these reports. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.960
everything from the p value to the point biserial.&nbsp;
There's something called the discrimination index,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.560
the upper and lower 27 percent. A lot of&nbsp;
that plays into the other statistics here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.760
and then something called the kr20 which takes a&nbsp;
look at the assessments performance as a whole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.920
so we'll get into all of this, And finally we'll&nbsp;
wrap up by identifying best practice standards for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.280
assessing the analytics. Okay so first question is&nbsp;
well what's what's in it for me, or I should say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.040
what's in it for you because you're the one who's&nbsp;
creating the exams and the exam questions. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000
you take a look at a particular question and the&nbsp;
statistics, so how do I know whether it's a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.920
question or not and how do i tell just by looking&nbsp;
at the statistics and is there more to it than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.360
just the the p-value the the average score and&nbsp;
then if there is something not quite right, how do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.160
i reconcile this? What do I know about the exam's&nbsp;
past with what the data is telling me about now. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.520
few things to keep in mind when you're evaluating&nbsp;
an assessment you not only want to obviously look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.160
at the assessment's performance as a whole, you've&nbsp;
got a good class average and such, but you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.960
look at each of the exam questions and not just&nbsp;
that but look at each of the distractors, as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.440
so you want to look at the questions how do they&nbsp;
perform, but then also look at the response sets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.880
to see if there might be certain distractors that&nbsp;
students chose over another and why that might be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
Was the information conveyed correctly?&nbsp;
Was there maybe a misunderstanding?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
Was this distractor perhaps the correct&nbsp;
answer as well? So these are things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.400
you want to look at. Now Examsoft has&nbsp;
something called a psychometrics report.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.800
This is the mathematical statistics of each of&nbsp;
the questions and of the assessment overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000
Then you as faculty will be able to identify&nbsp;
just how the questions are performing so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840
without too much more of an introduction on&nbsp;
my part, I'm going to turn things over to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.600
colleague Vladimir Merisca. If you click on&nbsp;
the "What's the Stat" he'll give you more.
