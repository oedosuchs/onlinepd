00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.510
Hi there, I'm Dave Juergens once again, and
I know that we just provided you with a lot

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.310
of new information here.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.759
We just want you to have a basic understanding
as to how item analysis works.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.170
If we make any adjustments to scores, that
they of course will affect students, some

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.850
positively, but some negatively, so we want
to make sure that we're doing this correctly.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.260
Now when an exam or quiz is over we as the
instructional designers will get a look at

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.930
the item analysis report.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.930
We'll go through that.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.180
we'll flag the obvious like a mis-keyed item.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.260
But we're also going to look at the other
statistics and kind of determine, were there

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.329
students that answered another question incorrectly,
but a good number of them did so.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.250
We just want the instructor then to take a
look at that to make the determination as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
to whether we need to add a second correct
or not.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.750
It may be right the way it is which is, but
this is up to you the faculty, the people

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.120
that put this together and did the lectures
to tell us any changes that may need to be

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120
added.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.390
Now I want to go back to a couple of things
that Brea had mentioned.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.829
First of all, mis-keyed items.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.710
If we see that 90% of students answered it
incorrectly, we'll have to assume that there's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.710
a mis-key.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.240
So we'll go back to the original document
the instructor sent us and if it's mis-keyed

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.240
on our end we'll of course make that change
and re-score the exam.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.780
However, sometimes, it's the instructor that
provided us with, you know highlighted the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.880
wrong answer, so we'll send that back to the
instructor and then it's up to them to tells,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.280
"Hey change that from A to B," for example.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
Now something I do want to mention here about
bonus points.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.799
Now keep in mind that if we make a question
a bonus, the students that got it correct

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.470
to begin with, don't get an extra point.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.150
They just get the same point as everybody
else.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.260
What happens with a bonus question, let's
say it's a 25-question exam.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.869
It'll re-score it as a 24-question exam and
then everybody gets a point for the 25th question.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.560
So it's possible then for students to have
more than 100% as they score 25 out of 24.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
Now another option is to accept all answers,
a-b-c-d and e.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.599
What happens here is that it still scores
it as, once again as a 25-question exam the

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.780
way it was set up originally, but now everybody
gets credit for that one question.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.060
So again the student that had that right to
begin with, doesn't get any additional credit.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.950
They just get the same point as everybody
else.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.540
Kinda keep that in mind.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.849
Now we're going to wrap it up here.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.960
I just wanted to show you some of the resources
that we went to.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.180
We got a lot of information from Examsoft
itself, but there are others doing research

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.600
in this area, and if you click on some those
links I think you'll find them rather informative.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.160
So having said that I think we'll wrap it
up here.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.250
Of course if you have any questions please
contact us at The Office of Educational Development,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.810
and our email address is chsoed@okstate.edu.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.579
So that being said, I thank you for your time
and I hope you a wonderful rest of the day!
