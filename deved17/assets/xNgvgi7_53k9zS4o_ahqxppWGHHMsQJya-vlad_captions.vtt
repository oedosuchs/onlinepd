Hello and thank you for taking the time to delve&nbsp;
deeper into this session. My name is Vladimir&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.960
Merisca, Instructional Design Coordinator&nbsp;
at the Office of Educational Development.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.080
Let's get right into what the statistics&nbsp;
in your item analysis reports mean.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.080
The exam stat we're looking at&nbsp;
here is the difficulty index&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.480
what that measures is the proportion of students&nbsp;
who answered an item correctly. The higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.960
the value the greater the proportion of students&nbsp;who
responded to an item correctly. The lower the value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.840
indicates that fewer students got the question&nbsp;
correct. Those values are also known as p-values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.400
a difficulty index or p-value of equal to or&nbsp;
greater than 70 percent means your question would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.720
be considered easy to very easy. If your p-value&nbsp;
is in the mid-range of equal to or less than 30&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.600
then you're in the difficulty range&nbsp;
for values equal to or less than 30&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.840
That means your question falls&nbsp;
within the range of very difficult

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.880
For exam questions that have p-values&nbsp;
of 90 or higher or 20 and lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.760
consider adjusting your questions or not using&nbsp;
them at all in future exams. For example on those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.440
90 or higher items consider restructuring&nbsp;
your questions' lead-in or distractors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.320
On those 20 percent or lower items review&nbsp;
them for possible confusing language or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.720
perhaps it's a topic you may want to&nbsp;
amend in your future class instruction

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.200
A point biserial statistic indicates whether&nbsp;
getting the question correct correlates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.120
positively or negatively with performing&nbsp;
well on the exam overall. In other words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.960
if students scored well on the exam as a&nbsp;
whole they should on average score well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.240
on the item students who performed&nbsp;
poorly on the item did poorly on the exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.120
A point biserial closer to zero indicates&nbsp;
little correlation between the performance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.960
of the question and the performance on the test&nbsp;
as a whole. This may indicate that the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.840
tested on the material outside of the other&nbsp;
learning outcomes assessed on the exam or that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.040
this may indicate that the question tested on&nbsp;
material outside of the other learning outcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.440
assessed on the exam or that it was a mastery item&nbsp;
where all or most of the class got the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.840
correct. A point biserial closer to 1&nbsp;
indicates a very strong correlation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.520
negative point biserial scores indicate&nbsp;
a negative correlation between the two

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.840
Your report stats will often reference Upper 27&nbsp;
percent and Lower 27 percent. These upper and Lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.240
groups of students are based on the top 27 percent&nbsp;
and bottom 27 percent of performers respectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.760
The top 27 of scores represent&nbsp;
the percentage of students who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.760
answered the item correctly, whereas the bottom&nbsp;
27 percent of scores represent the percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.560
students who answered the item incorrectly. 27&nbsp;
is an industry standard used in item analyses.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.280
The discrimination index of a&nbsp;
question shows the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440
in performance between the upper&nbsp;
and lower 27 percent of performers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.120
That value is determined by subtracting&nbsp;
the difficulty index of the lower 27&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:58.400
from the difficulty index of the upper 27 percent&nbsp;
negative values of values nearing 0.0 indicates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.680
that the bottom 27 percent did better. Those&nbsp;
items should be considered for removal.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.320
Here's some more guidance on discrimination&nbsp;
index numbers typically for the discriminating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.040
items discrimination index above 30&nbsp;
percent is considered pretty good

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.760
Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 or your kr20 stat&nbsp;
measures exam items reliability and consistency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.800
in other words the statistic reflects the&nbsp;
likelihood that your students will yield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.960
the same performance if given the same exam a&nbsp;
higher value for the exam indicates a strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.280
relationship between items on the test a&nbsp;
value of at least 70 percent is desirable

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.160
A low kr20 means that the results&nbsp;
would be more likely to be different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.520
Let's take a look at a section&nbsp;
of an item analysis report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:10.080
In it you see your kr20 value alongside a mean&nbsp;
value which is the average score of all your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.960
exam takers. There's also a median score here&nbsp;
which marks the midpoint of exam taker scores&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.040
and there's a standard deviation value. The&nbsp;
standard deviation indicates the variation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.920
exam scores. A low standard deviation indicates&nbsp;
that students' scores were close to the average,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.600
while a high standard deviation indicates&nbsp;
that there was a large variation in scores.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.800
In this item analysis report there's&nbsp;
a 94 difficulty index or p-value which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.680
indicates a very easy question that your&nbsp;
team may want to consider for adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.560
Your discrimination index is 11 which is&nbsp;
considered a poor discrimination value,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.160
thereby requiring further scrutiny the&nbsp;
point biserial of 27, which is less than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.600
30 percent. So you will want to discuss if&nbsp;
there were any issues with this question

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.760
Be mindful that while the&nbsp;
psychometric rules might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.440
generally correct, there are other non-statistical&nbsp;
factors that can influence the performance of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.320
question which must also be taken into account&nbsp;
when determining a question's validity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.760
are the nuts and bolts behind the statistics&nbsp;
of an item analysis report. You can always&nbsp;&nbsp;
