00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.920
Hello my name is Brea Moore and I'm an&nbsp;
instructional designer in the Office of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.560
Educational Development. Now that we went over&nbsp;
what the numbers on the item analysis represent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.680
let's talk about the adjustments you can weigh on&nbsp;
here you can make on your exam. The first of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560
adjustments you can make is you can modify the&nbsp;
exam and we'll go over both of these things in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.080
a little bit more detail but this means&nbsp;
you can remove a question from the exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.520
or you can make a question a bonus. You can choose&nbsp;
to modify the key and the options for modifying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.000
the key or you can accept multiple correct answers&nbsp;
on a question or you can correct a mis-keyed item&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.640
and we'll discuss the weight of those adjustments&nbsp;
as well. And finally you can add additional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.920
points. In doing so you can add points to all&nbsp;
students' scores if you felt like there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.880
several questions that maybe students struggled&nbsp;
with and you want to adjust, or you may choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:57.840
to accept all answers to a question. So let's&nbsp;
get started with modifying the exam itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.720
So the first choice that you have if you&nbsp;
want to modify exam is removing a question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.560
So the example we're going to use is an&nbsp;
examination has 25 questions in total.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.160
Your instructional designer has identified three&nbsp;
questions on an item analysis for your review.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.480
As the course director you decide to remove these&nbsp;
three questions from the exam, and this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.480
be reducing the total possible points to 22. So&nbsp;
let's see how this affects students. Your original&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.960
results is student A has 21 out of 25 correct,&nbsp;
for an 84 percent and student b has 21 out of 25&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.440
correct for an 84 percent, however the questions&nbsp;
that we are going to look at are questions two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.920
three and four. Those are the questions you've&nbsp;
chosen to remove. As you can see student A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.320
got all three of those questions correct, and&nbsp;
student B got all three of those questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
incorrect. So let's see what starts to happen to&nbsp;
students' scores as we remove those questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.520
As soon as we remove question number two,&nbsp;
student A goes down to a 20 out of 24,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.360
and student B goes down to it--goes UP to a&nbsp;
21 out of 24. So as you can see the benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.080
of getting the answer correct has now been&nbsp;
removed and the penalty for getting the answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.720
incorrect has been removed and so the students&nbsp;
scores are going in the opposite directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.440
So finally if after we remove all three of the&nbsp;
questions, student A now has an 18 out of 22&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.240
and student B has a 21 out of 22. So student B&nbsp;
originally got those three questions incorrect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.080
now has a much higher score than student A with&nbsp;
a 25 percent. So the most common complaint when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.120
something like this happens from the student&nbsp;
is, "I got the question right, how come my score&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.960
is now lower?" So it's it's best to use caution&nbsp;
when choosing to remove a question from the exam.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
So if you decide to make a question bonus we're&nbsp;
going to use the same scenario with 25 questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920
total, the same three questions, except this time&nbsp;
we're going to make all three questions bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
So again questions two three and four and question&nbsp;
or the questions we're looking at, student A and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.080
student B both originate at 84 percent. After the&nbsp;
adjustments are made and student A now has bonus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.400
points for those questions. They are at 21 out&nbsp;
of 22 questions correct and with a 95 percent and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.960
student B also has a 95 percent. Their score&nbsp;
has removed to a 21 out of 22 as well because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.040
the questions were actually removed from the&nbsp;
exam, which took the um total questions possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.400
down and so both students have a 95 percent. So&nbsp;
students who miss the question still actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.600
benefit from making it a bonus question because&nbsp;
the questions are no longer figured into the exam.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.560
Now if we choose to modify the key we can do this&nbsp;
in a couple ways. You can accept multiple correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.480
answers for a question, so maybe you have a&nbsp;
question and it came up on the item analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.680
your instructional design marked for your review.&nbsp;
You then looked back through the materials and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.360
found that you not only had one answer on&nbsp;
the question that could have been correct,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.560
but you had a second equally correct answer&nbsp;
and you've chosen to mark that correct now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.160
as well. If there is more than one correct answer&nbsp;
available and the key is modified this gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.160
credit for all equally correct answers across&nbsp;
the board and so there is no student that will be

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.640
lose the benefit of giving multiple correct&nbsp;
answers if they have chosen the same the correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.080
answers. So number two is correcting a mis-keyed&nbsp;
question. This is (if) you've found a question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.160
on the exam that was miskeyed, you've changed&nbsp;
the key to correct that miss key question. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.680
gives answers to all the students who answered&nbsp;
the question correctly. Now the most common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.240
misconception that you may hear from students&nbsp;
is, "Why did my score go down? I saw my raw score&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.960
on Examsoft, it showed that I had this and now I&nbsp;
have this." And they don't understand that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.400
actually did not get the question right originally&nbsp;
and that's why their points have been taken away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.440
So when you're correcting a mis-key question&nbsp;
just be aware that this may take a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.840
bit of additional explaining to students to&nbsp;
understand why their scores did in fact change.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.000
Now as a benevolent instructor&nbsp;
you may choose to add points.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.320
How can you add points? You can give points&nbsp;
across the top of the exam to all students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.280
and so you may have found that there were several&nbsp;
questions of difficulty on this exam and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.520
don't want to change the exam key, you don't want&nbsp;
to make them bonus, you don't want to remove them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.240
but you feel especially that the students&nbsp;
deserve some extra points and all students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.720
deserve those points equally, therefore&nbsp;
you're just going to give maybe two points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.160
across the board to all students. You can also&nbsp;
choose to accept all answers on a question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.800
This is the people pleasing solution. All&nbsp;
students benefit from this. You've accepted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.200
all of the answers that may be a question where&nbsp;
your distractors were very similar, it may be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.880
question where you have discovered the content&nbsp;
was not covered in the way you thought it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and so you've chosen to accept all answers. This&nbsp;
is essentially giving a free point to all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.960
students. So the biggest takeaway from this&nbsp;
is just to be aware that every adjustment that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.840
you make on your exam will affect a student&nbsp;
either positive or negatively in some way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.160
and that to take those into account as you&nbsp;
start to make your adjustments. Thank you!
